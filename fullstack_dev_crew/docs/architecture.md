# Technical Architecture Document: Task Management and Collaboration Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture for a comprehensive Task Management and Collaboration Platform designed for small to medium-sized teams (5-50 members). The platform will provide core functionalities such as project and task management, real-time team collaboration, file sharing, time tracking, reporting, and notifications. Built with a modern technology stack including Next.js 15+ for the frontend, Node.js for the backend API, PostgreSQL for data storage, and WebSockets for real-time communication, the architecture emphasizes scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. The system is designed to be production-ready, mobile-responsive, and accessible (WCAG 2.1), supporting remote and hybrid work environments. It aims to handle concurrent users, real-time updates, and scale to support growing user bases.

## 2. Project Overview

The Task Management and Collaboration Platform aims to centralize team workflows, enhance communication, and improve productivity. It provides a single source of truth for project status, tasks, deadlines, and related documents. The platform caters specifically to teams of 5-50 members, project managers, and team leads requiring efficient task assignment, tracking, and collaborative features. The technical implementation prioritizes a responsive user interface, real-time updates for collaborative features, robust security measures, and a scalable infrastructure capable of handling concurrent users and future growth.

```

**Description:**

*   **Client Browsers:** The user interface layer, rendered by the Next.js application. Handles user input and displays data received from the backend and real-time services.
*   **Load Balancer/CDN:** Acts as the entry point for client requests. Distributes traffic across Next.js instances and caches static assets globally for improved performance and reduced origin load.
*   **Next.js Backend:** Handles server-side rendering, static asset serving, and acts as an initial API gateway for specific routes (e.g., authentication, simpler data fetches) or proxies requests to the core Backend Service API. Can utilize Next.js API Routes or Edge Functions.
*   **Backend Service API:** The core application logic. A stateless API built with Node.js/Express, responsible for processing business logic, interacting with the database, file storage, and external services. It handles complex data operations and authorization.
*   **Real-time Service:** A dedicated Node.js application hosting a WebSocket server (e.g., Socket.IO). Manages persistent connections with clients and pushes real-time updates (e.g., task changes, new comments, notifications) triggered by actions originating from the Backend Service API or other events. It may directly interact with the database or receive updates via a message queue.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:** The central relational database storing all application data.
*   **File Storage Service:** A cloud object storage service used for storing file attachments, separate from the database.
*   **Email Notification Service:** A third-party service integrated for sending asynchronous email notifications.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** A centralized system for collecting logs, metrics, and traces from all application components for monitoring health, performance, and debugging.

### 4.2. Database Schema Design

The database schema is designed to support the core relationships between users, teams, projects, tasks, comments, and attachments, along with tracking time and notifications.

    tasks }o--o| tasks : "parent"
```

**Key considerations:**

*   Using UUIDs for primary keys across tables provides better distribution for clustered databases and avoids exposing sequential IDs.
*   `team_members` and `task_assignees` are linking tables for many-to-many relationships.
*   `comments` table includes `task_id` and optionally `project_id` for flexibility, and `parent_comment_id` for threading.
*   `attachments` can be linked to tasks, projects, or comments. `file_url` stores the location in the external storage service.
*   `notifications` table tracks in-app notifications and links to relevant entities.
*   Indices will be created on foreign key columns and columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or ORDER BY clauses (e.g., `tasks.project_id`, `tasks.status`, `comments.task_id`, `time_entries.user_id`, `time_entries.task_id`, `notifications.user_id`, `notifications.created_at`).

### 4.3. API Design and Specifications

The Backend Service API will be a RESTful API serving JSON data.

*   **Base URL:** `https://api.yourplatform.com/v1`
*   **Authentication:** JWT via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
*   **Request/Response:** JSON format.
*   **Error Handling:** Standard HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) with descriptive JSON error bodies (e.g., `{ "message": "Not Found", "code": 404 }`).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Applied to login and registration endpoints, and potentially other heavy endpoints.
*   **Input Validation:** All incoming request bodies and query parameters are validated on the server.

**Example Endpoints & Data Flow (Illustrative - not exhaustive):**

*   **`POST /v1/auth/login`**: Authenticates user. Input: `{ email, password }`. Output: `{ token, refreshToken }`.
*   **`GET /v1/teams/:teamId/projects`**: Get all projects for a specific team (requires team membership authorization). Output: `[{ projectId, name, status, ... }]`.
*   **`POST /v1/projects/:projectId/tasks`**: Create a new task in a project (requires project team membership and appropriate role). Input: `{ title, description, dueDate, priority, assigneeIds: [...] }`. Output: `{ taskId, title, status, ... }`.
    *   *Data Flow:* Frontend -> API -> Auth Middleware -> Validation -> Task Service -> Database Insert -> (Async) Notification Service -> API Response -> Frontend receives response. Real-time Service receives event (via pub/sub or DB trigger) -> WebSocket push to relevant clients.
*   **`GET /v1/tasks/:taskId/comments`**: Get comments for a task. Output: `[{ commentId, content, userId, createdAt, ... }]`. Supports pagination.
*   **`POST /v1/tasks/:taskId/comments`**: Add a comment. Input: `{ content, parentCommentId }`. Output: `{ commentId, content, ... }`.
    *   *Data Flow:* Similar to creating a task, but triggers real-time update specifically for comments on that task and potentially mentions/notifications.
*   **`POST /v1/attachments/upload-url`**: Request a pre-signed URL for uploading. Input: `{ fileName, fileType, fileSize, relatedEntityId, relatedEntityType }`. Output: `{ uploadUrl, attachmentId }`.
*   **`POST /v1/time-entries`**: Log time. Input: `{ taskId, startTime, endTime, notes }`. Output: `{ timeEntryId, ... }`.
*   **`GET /v1/reports/time?userId=&projectId=&startDate=&endDate=`**: Get time report. Output: `{ totalDuration, entries: [...] }`.

### 4.4. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Authentication:** JWT-based.
    *   Short-lived access tokens (JWT) for API authentication.
    *   Longer-lived refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without re-login. Refresh tokens stored securely in HTTP-only, SameSite=Strict, Secure cookies.
    *   Access tokens stored in browser memory or a secure context and sent via `Authorization: Bearer` header.
    *   Token revocation mechanism on the backend (e.g., storing revoked token IDs or user session data in Redis).
*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with resource ownership/membership checks.
    *   Roles defined at the team level (`admin`, `member`).
    *   Backend middleware and service logic check user's role and their association with the specific team, project, or task being accessed/modified.
    *   Example: Only Team Admins can invite new members. Only members of a project's team can view/edit its tasks. Only task assignees or team admins can change task status.

### 4.5. Frontend State Management

Leveraging Next.js 15+ features:

*   **React Server Components (RSC):** Used for initial data fetching and rendering of less dynamic parts of the UI (e.g., initial project lists, user profiles) to improve perceived performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.
*   **Client Components:** Used for interactive parts of the application (forms, real-time updates, drag-and-drop).
*   **Data Fetching & Caching:** React Query or SWR will manage data fetching from the API in Client Components, providing caching, background revalidation, and state synchronization.
*   **Global State:** Zustand or Jotai for managing UI state not tied to specific data fetches, or small pieces of global state (e.g., modal visibility, theme). This can also manage state updates triggered by WebSocket messages.
*   **Real-time State:** WebSocket client logic will receive real-time updates and dispatch actions to update the appropriate state (managed by React Query/SWR cache or global state manager), triggering UI re-renders.

### 4.6. File Structure and Project Organization

A monorepo structure using NPM workspaces or Yarn workspaces is recommended to manage related but distinct projects (frontend, backend, realtime-service) within a single repository.

```
/task-platform (root)
├── package.json (monorepo config)
├── /frontend (Next.js App)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── next.config.js
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   ├── /src
│   │   ├── /app (App Router)
│   │   ├── /components
│   │   ├── /lib
│   │   ├── /hooks
│   │   ├── /store (e.g., Zustand)
│   │   ├── /styles
│   │   └── /types
│   └── ...
├── /backend (Node.js/Express API)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   ├── /src
│   │   ├── /api (Controllers/Routes)
│   │   ├── /services (Business Logic)
│   │   ├── /db (Database interaction, Migrations)
│   │   ├── /middleware
│   │   ├── /utils
│   │   └── /types
│   ├── /migrations
│   └── ...
├── /realtime-service (Node.js/WebSocket Server)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   ├── /src
│   │   ├── server.ts
│   │   ├── /handlers
│   │   └── /utils
│   └── ...
├── /shared (Optional: Shared types, constants)
│   ├── package.json
│   └── /src
└── docker-compose.yml (for local development/testing)
```

This structure promotes code sharing (if `shared` is used) while keeping concerns separated. Each project can have its own dependencies and build process.

*   **Monitoring & Logging Tools:** Essential for understanding application behavior in production, diagnosing issues, monitoring performance, and ensuring stability.
*   **Containerization & CI/CD:** Standard practices for ensuring consistent environments from development to production and automating the build, test, and deployment process, crucial for a production-ready application.

## 6. Security Architecture

A multi-layered security approach covers authentication, authorization, data protection, and vulnerability mitigation.

*   **Authentication (JWT Flow):**
    1.  User logs in with credentials.
    2.  Backend validates credentials (using bcrypt for password hashing).
    3.  Backend generates short-lived Access Token (JWT) and a longer-lived Refresh Token.
    4.  Access Token returned in API response body. Refresh Token set as an HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie.
    5.  Frontend sends Access Token in `Authorization: Bearer` header for protected requests.
    6.  Backend middleware verifies Access Token signature and expiry.
    7.  If Access Token expires, Frontend uses Refresh Token cookie to request a new Access Token from a dedicated `/auth/refresh` endpoint.
    8.  `/auth/refresh` endpoint validates Refresh Token and issues a new Access Token and Refresh Token pair.
    9.  Logout clears tokens on client and server-side (e.g., blacklisting JWT/Refresh Token ID).

*   **Authorization and Access Control:**
    *   Implemented strictly on the Backend API.
    *   Middleware checks if user is authenticated (valid JWT).
    *   Service layer logic checks if the authenticated user is authorized to perform the requested action on the specific resource:
        *   Check user's role within the relevant team (`team_members` table).
        *   Check if the resource (project, task) belongs to a team the user is a member of.
        *   Check specific relationships (e.g., is the user assigned to this task?).
*   **Data Security:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Enforced for all client-backend and inter-service communication.
    *   **Password Hashing:** Bcrypt with a sufficient cost factor.
    *   **Database:** Encryption at rest using cloud provider options. Configure strict network access controls for the database.
    *   **File Storage:** Encryption at rest configured on the cloud storage bucket. Access controlled via IAM policies and pre-signed URLs.
*   **Common Vulnerability Mitigation:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Server-side validation on all API endpoints.
    *   **XSS:** Sanitize user-generated content before rendering. Use React's automatic escaping.
    *   **CSRF:** Utilize HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens and potentially implement token-based CSRF protection for sensitive state-changing operations if not fully relying on cookie security properties.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries via the chosen ORM/Query Builder. Avoid manual string concatenation for queries.
    *   **Secure File Uploads:** Validate file types/sizes server-side. Use pre-signed URLs. Store outside webroot.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** On authentication endpoints.
    *   **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Regular security audits of dependencies using tools.

## 7. Deployment Architecture

The application components are deployed as scalable services in a cloud environment.

## 9. Risk Analysis and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                                    | Impact      | Likelihood  | Mitigation Strategies                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complexity of real-time features        | High        | Medium      | Use robust library (Socket.IO) with proven scaling methods (Redis Pub/Sub). Isolate real-time logic in a dedicated service. |
| Database performance bottlenecks        | High        | Medium      | Thorough schema design & indexing. Use ORM/Query Builder correctly. Monitor query performance. Plan for read replicas. |
| Security vulnerabilities / Data breach  | Very High   | Medium      | Strict authentication/authorization (JWT refresh, RBAC, resource checks). Input validation. HTTPS everywhere. Secure secret management. Regular security audits & updates. |
| Scalability challenges under load       | High        | Medium      | Design services to be stateless for horizontal scaling. Use managed cloud services (Fargate, GKE, RDS, S3). Implement load testing. |
| Integration with third-party services (Email, Storage) | Medium      | Medium      | Use standard SDKs. Implement retry mechanisms and error handling. Monitor service status.                            |

## 10. Performance and Scalability

*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Backend:** Implement database connection pooling. Use efficient ORM/Query Builder practices (e.g., eager loading to avoid N+1). Implement backend caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed static or slow-changing data. Optimize API routes.
    *   **Database:** Comprehensive indexing strategy. Regular `EXPLAIN` analysis of slow queries. Consider database tuning parameters.
    *   **Frontend:** Code splitting, lazy loading components. Image optimization. Virtualization for long lists. Efficient state updates. Memoization of components and expensive calculations.
    *   **Real-time:** Efficiently manage WebSocket connections and rooms. Broadcast messages only to necessary clients. Minimize data size in messages.
    *   **File Storage:** Use pre-signed URLs to bypass backend for file data transfer.
*   **Scalability Planning:**
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** The stateless nature of the Backend API and Real-time service allows adding more instances behind a load balancer as traffic increases. Containerization facilitates this.
    *   **Database Scaling:** Start with vertical scaling (larger instance size). Implement read replicas for read-heavy operations. Consider database clustering for high availability and write scaling if needed.
    *   **Real-time Scaling:** Use a Pub/Sub layer (like Redis) with Socket.IO to coordinate message broadcasting across multiple WebSocket server instances.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (SQS, RabbitMQ) for background tasks like sending bulk emails, generating large reports, or processing file uploads, offloading work from the main API threads.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement robust APM (e.g., Sentry, Datadog), centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, CloudWatch Logs), and infrastructure/application metrics monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch Metrics). Monitor key performance indicators (API latency, error rates, database connection usage, CPU/Memory load, WebSocket connections).

## 11. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for ensuring a production-ready application:

*   **Unit Tests:** Cover individual functions, components, and small modules. Focus on logic correctness. (Tools: Jest, React Testing Library).
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between integrated components or services (e.g., backend service interacting with the database, frontend components interacting with API). (Tools: Jest, Supertest, MSW).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate realistic user flows through the entire application, covering frontend, backend, and database interactions. Essential for verifying core user journeys (login, create task, add comment, etc.). (Tools: Cypress, Playwright).
*   **Performance Tests:** Load testing on backend and real-time services to identify bottlenecks and determine capacity limits. Frontend performance profiling. (Tools: JMeter, k6, Lighthouse).
*   **Security Tests:** Automated vulnerability scanning (SAST, DAST), dependency scanning, manual security reviews, potential penetration testing before launch.
*   **Accessibility Tests:** Automated checks using tools (Lighthouse, Axe) and manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1.

Tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce code quality and prevent regressions with every commit.
